# Algebraic QC-LDPC construction tools Matlab and C++
Matlab implementation of algebraic methods for construction QC-LDPC codes parity-check matrix using Projective Geometry, Finite Geometry, Latin Square, BIBD Design, Lattice Grid and etc



Folder  egldpc-0.4 contain C++ source code to make Euclidean Geometry LDPC codes parity matrix and low-density generator matrix (LDGM) codes, from Fernando Pujaico Rivera. For efficient decoding of Euclidean Geometry LDPC code and LDGM codes use hard decoders (BFS SHBF PHBF SSSBF PSSBF WBF MWBF) from https://github.com/Lcrypto/LDPC-Iterative-Bit-Flipping-family-decoders
