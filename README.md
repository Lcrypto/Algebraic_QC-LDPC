# Matlab and C++ tools for Algebraic QC-LDPC codes construction   
Matlab implementation of algebraic methods for construction Quasi Cyclic and Cyclic LDPC codes parity-check matrix using Projective Geometry, Affine Geometry, Euclidean Geometry, Finite Geometry, Latin Square, BIBD Design, RS code, Lattice Grid and etc



Folder  egldpc-0.4 contain C++ source code to make Euclidean Geometry LDPC codes parity matrix and low-density generator matrix (LDGM) codes, from Fernando Pujaico Rivera. For efficient hard decoding of Euclidean Geometry LDPC code and LDGM codes use BFS SHBF PHBF SSSBF PSSBF WBF MWBF decoders from https://github.com/Lcrypto/LDPC-Iterative-Bit-Flipping-family-decoders
