Euclidean Geometry LDPC
=======================

Create a type-I EG-LDPC code with a parity check matrix H of N columns and J lines and a generator matrix 
G of K lines and N columns, polynomials will represent the lines. These matrices are created from an EG(m,2^s), 
which is a Euclidean geometry of dimension "m" and "2^s" points per dimension.
It is necessary to deliver as data "m" or "s" and the primitive polynomial generator of the GE, the polynomial must have degree n=m*s, N=2^n-1.

primitive polynomial: 	p(x)=X^4+x+1	--> {4,1,0}
n:		n=4
Given the  m*s=n   m:	m=2
Then:		s=2

Now to generate a type I EGLDPC:

generator-matrix-egldpc	 --pos-one 4  --pos-one 1  --pos-one 0 -m 2 -s 2 

El programa retorna:

<<Reporte>>
N=	15
K=	7
Rc=	0.4667
J=	15
STANDARD LINES:	1
LINES:	4
0	1	3	7	
POLI-GERA:	5
0	4	6	7	8	
<<End of programm>>

Where:

H=H_{J}{N}, H parity-check matrix it is created by cyclically rotating all hi(X) N times.

similar for generator matrix G but using g(x) polynomial

0<= i < STANDARD LINES

{0, 1, 3, 7} --> h0(X)=1+X+X^3+X^7

{0, 4, 6, 7, 8} --> g(X)=1+X^4+X^6+X^7+X^8
